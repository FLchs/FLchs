# 👋 François Lachèse

Hi, I'm François — a pragmatic engineer based in France who builds things with intention and efficiency.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript (mainly), a bit of Python
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind, TUI (ncurses), Markdown
- **Backend**: Hono, Express, Drizzle, Prisma, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL
- **Tools**: Neovim, tmux, Arch Linux, GitHub Actions, k3s
- **Self-hosting**: Home Assistant, Jellyfin, Lidarr, Navidrome, and more

## 🛠️ Projects & Hobbies

- 🔧 Building **fullstack TypeScript apps** with modern tools like Hono, Bun, Drizzle, and TanStack
- 🧭 Designing terminal UI tools like [`cursedtodo`](https://github.com/FLchs/cursedtodo)
- 🧠 Automating my digital life (and occasionally breaking it) with Home Assistant, ESPHome, and Zigbee
- 🎸 Playing guitar and crafting music playlists
- 🛰️ Hosting my own services, running Kubernetes on low-power gear, and advocating for **data ownership**

## 🚧 Currently Experimenting With

- Fullstack development using **Bun**, **Hono**, and **TanStack** libraries
- Refining a minimalist personal ecosystem (mail, notes, passwords, tasks)
- Learning about audio tagging, FOSS, and long-term digital autonomy

## 📌 Philosophy

- 🦾 If you don’t control the stack, the stack controls you.
- 📵 No dark patterns, no vendor lock-in, no "cloud for cloud’s sake".
- 🧱 Open-source over everything. If it's broken, I’ll fix it... or build my own.

## 📬 Reach out

If you're into FOSS, self-hosting, or looking for a remote developer/devops engineer, let's talk.
